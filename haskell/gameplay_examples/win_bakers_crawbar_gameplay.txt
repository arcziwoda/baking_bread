Walter: Yo, Jesse, you there?
Jesse: Yeah, Mr. Black, what's up?
Walter: It's been a rough day, huh?
Jesse: You bet. These blue muffins are no joke.
Walter: We need to finish them up.
> talk_to jesse
Jesse: Man, I never thought baking could be this intense.
Walter: It's all about precision, Jesse. One wrong move and it's all over.
Jesse: Yeah, yeah, I get it. But these muffins... they're something else.
Walter: They have to be perfect. Our reputation depends on it.
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black, what's the final ingredient for the cake?
Jesse: I totally forgot, man. Maybe you should look around to see what's on the table.
> look_around
Walter: Let's see what's on the table...
[sees sugar, blue food coloring, baking soda and los pollos hermanos sauce]

Walter: That's it! The final ingredient for the muffins is blue_food_coloring!
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black! These muffins are gonna be tight!

Walter: Damn it, Saul! How much time do we have?
Saul Badman: Not much, maybe a few minutes. You need to move!
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black, this is bad. What do we do?
Walter: We need to get to the main door, Jesse. Now!
Jesse: Alright, let's go!
> go_to main_door
Jesse: Yo, the door won't open!
Walter: Damn it, it can only be unlocked by a key card. I think it's locked in Sus' office.
Jesse: And how do we get there?
Walter: We don't have the key, but we could try to pick the lock.
Jesse: I ain't no locksmith, we should use some Kvass to melt the lock.
Walter: We have to pick one of the options, we don't have much time left!

Walter: Let's see what we can find here...
[sees some metal wires, a screwdriver, a hammer, and a wrench]
Walter: These tools could help us make a lockpick. I belive it is made from two things.
