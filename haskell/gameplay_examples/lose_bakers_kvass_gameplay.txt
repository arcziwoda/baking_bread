Walter: Yo, Jesse, you there?
Jesse: Yeah, Mr. Black, what's up?
Walter: It's been a rough day, huh?
Jesse: You bet. These blue muffins are no joke.
Walter: We need to finish them up.
> talk_to jesse
Jesse: Man, I never thought baking could be this intense.
Walter: It's all about precision, Jesse. One wrong move and it's all over.
Jesse: Yeah, yeah, I get it. But these muffins... they're something else.
Walter: They have to be perfect. Our reputation depends on it.
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black, what's the final ingredient for the cake?
Jesse: I totally forgot, man. Maybe you should look around to see what's on the table.
> look_around
Walter: Let's see what's on the table...
[sees sugar, blue food coloring, baking soda and los pollos hermanos sauce]
> add muffins blue_food_coloring
Walter: That's it! The final ingredient for the muffins is blue_food_coloring!
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black! These muffins are gonna be tight!
Walter: Yes, Jesse. Now let's finish these muffins and move on.
[The phone rings]
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black! It's Saul! Better pick that up!
> talk_to saul
Saul Badman: Hey, Walter! It's Saul. Listen, the rival bakers are on their way. You gotta get outta there, man!
Walter: Damn it, Saul! How much time do we have?
Saul Badman: Not much, maybe a few minutes. You need to move!
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black, this is bad. What do we do?
Walter: We need to get to the main door, Jesse. Now!
Jesse: Alright, let's go!
> go_to main_door
Jesse: Yo, the door won't open!
Walter: Damn it, it can only be unlocked by a key card. I think it's locked in Sus' office.
Jesse: And how do we get there?
Walter: We don't have the key, but we could try to pick the lock.
Jesse: I ain't no locksmith, we should use some Kvass to melt the lock.
Walter: We have to pick one of the options, we don't have much time left!
> choose_path jesse
Time left: 23
Jesse: Yo, Mr. Black, we gotta go back to the lab to make the Kvass, let's go!
> go_to lab
Time left: 22
Jesse: I think we have some leftover Kvass from the last batch of bread.
Watler: Yes, over there, but it's pretty weak, it won't dissolve the lock quickly.
Jesse: Aight, then maybe we could add something to make it stronger or go straight to the office door and use it.
> look_around
Walter: What do we have here that could be useful...
[sees some whole grain bread, water, and some yeast]
> add kvass water
Time left: 21
Jesse: Do you want to add anything else or we good to go?
> go_to office_door
Time left: 20
Walter: Ok, the Kvass is ready, now let's take it to the office's door.
Jesse: Yo, I remember there was a pepper spray in the lab. Maybe we should take it?
Walter: I don't know Jesse, it will take some time to find it...
> use kvass
Time left: 16
Jesse: Aight, now let's pour this bad boy on the lock!
Walter: Here goes nothing...
It took 4 minutes to dissolve the lock
[Office door slowly opens]
> go_to office
Time left: 15
Jesse: Yessss, it worked Mr. Black, we're in!

Walter: Let's find that keycard...
[The office is small. There are shelves and desk with computer on it]
> search desk
Time left: 14
Walter: Found it!
Jesse: That's the stuff, Mr. Black!
[Reads the keycard: In order to open the main door you need to provide the PIN code]
Walter: Damn it Jesse, we need to hack the computer to get the PIN code!
Jesse: Let's do it!
> hack computer
Time left: 13
The encrypted password is: ebiil
Enter the decrypted password: 
lalala
Walter: Wrong password!
Jesse: My friend Cesar can help us with that task!
Jesse: Just call him and tell him the encryption with your shift guess!
> talk_to cesar
Time left: 12
Jesse: Let's see if Cesar picks up...
Cesar: Hello?
Jesse: Yo Cesar, it's Jesse, I don't have time to explain, but can you help us decrypt a computer password?
Cesar: Um... sure, what's the encrypted password?
ebiil
Cesar: Alright, now I need you to tell me by how much to shift the letters.
Enter the shift value: 
3
Jesse: Eee... I don't know, but maybe 3.
Cesar: ebiil shifted by 3 is hello.
> hack computer

Jack Welker: You're dead meat!
[Jack shoots Walter and Jesse]
