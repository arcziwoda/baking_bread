# Baking B(re)ad: The Lab Escape - Multi-Language Adventure Game

**Baking B(re)ad: The Lab Escape** is a text-based adventure game where you play as a chemistry teacher turned baker, trapped in a secret lab. Your goal is to navigate a series of puzzles and challenges to escape, using your unique skills in a race against time.

## Project Overview

This repository contains three distinct implementations of the game, each written in a different programming language to showcase diverse programming paradigms:

- **Prolog**: Delve into a logic programming approach where game states and puzzles are modeled using declarative rules.
- **Haskell**: Experience a functional take on game logic, emphasizing pure functions and immutability.
- **Smalltalk**: Explore an object-oriented version of the game, featuring dynamic message passing and encapsulation.

Each version is located in its own folder:

- `prolog/`
- `haskell/`
- `smalltalk/`

Each folder includes a detailed README with specific instructions on how to set up, build, and play that version of the game.

## University Project

This project was developed as part of a university course, demonstrating how the same game concept can be implemented in different programming languages. It serves both as an academic exercise and as a portfolio piece to highlight proficiency in multiple programming paradigms.

## How to Get Started

1. **Select Your Preferred Version**:  
   Choose the language you are most interested in or the one you'd like to explore:

   - For the **Prolog** version, navigate to the `prolog/` folder.
   - For the **Haskell** version, navigate to the `haskell/` folder.
   - For the **Smalltalk** version, navigate to the `smalltalk/` folder.

2. **Follow the Language-Specific Instructions**:  
   Each folder contains its own README file with comprehensive instructions on installation, building, and running the game.
